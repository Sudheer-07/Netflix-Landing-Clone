# Context

This project is a faithful recreation of the Netflix landing page, designed to demonstrate front-end development skills and responsive design principles. The Netflix landing page was chosen as a target for this clone because:

- It features a clean, modern UI with a focus on visual content
- It includes various interactive elements like carousels, modals, and dropdown menus
- It demonstrates responsive design principles that adapt to different screen sizes
- It incorporates thoughtful use of color, typography, and spacing
- It uses strategic content organization to guide users toward subscription options

The original Netflix landing page is one of the most recognized and effective entry points for a streaming service, employing persuasive design elements to showcase the platform's value proposition. By recreating this page, developers can practice implementing these high-quality UI patterns and responsive techniques.

This clone aims to reproduce the visual and interactive elements of the Netflix landing page without connecting to any actual Netflix services or using proprietary Netflix assets. It serves purely as a demonstration of front-end development capabilities.
